## Objectives

1. Explain the central limit theorem.  

2. For a normal distribution, use `R` to find probabilities and percentiles. 

## Reading 

[Chapter 7.4](https://moderndive.com/7-sampling.html#sampling-conclusion-central-limit-theorem)

[Appendix A.2](https://moderndive.com/A-appendixA.html#appendix-normal-curve)


## Lesson 

Work through the learning checks LCA.1 - LCA.2.

+ The central limit theorem is difficult. The key idea is that if we create a point estimate that is using summation, then the **distribution of this point estimate** tends to be normal. The larger he sample, the closer the distribution is to being normal. If we are finding a mean, then the larger the sample, the smaller the standard error.

+ Use `R` to find probabilities. This implies the use of `pnorm()` and `qnorm()`.

Let's do a simulation.

Suppose we record the time of arrival of 4 friends.

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
set.seed(316)
(time<-round(runif(4,5,6),2))
```
We are generating 4 random numbers in the interval 5 to 6. We record these and find the average.

```{r}
mean(time)
```

This is just one value. What is the distribution of the mean if we were to repeat this? Since this is a simulation, we can do this many, many times and plot the distribution of the mean. Don't worry about the code for doing this.

```{r}
# Repeat this 1000 times
rep_data<-tibble(ave=replicate(1000,mean(round(runif(4,5,6),2))))
```


```{r}
summary(rep_data)
```

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(rep_data,aes(x=ave)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlim(5.1,5.9) +
  theme_classic()
```

Notice how this distribution of is approximately normal. That is the central limit theorem. If we used 10 points per sample instead of 4, the standard error would be smaller. 

```{r}
# Repeat this 1000 times
rep_data2<-tibble(ave=replicate(1000,mean(round(runif(10,5,6),2))))
```


```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(rep_data2,aes(x=ave)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlim(5.1,5.9) +
  theme_classic()
```

- Run the code again, but change the sample size.

### LC A.1 (Objective 2)

**(LCA.1)** What proportion of the area under the normal curve is less than 3? Greater than 12? Between 0 and 12?

**Solution:**

### LC A.2 (Objective 2)

**(LCA.1)** What is the 2.5th percentile of the area under the normal curve? The 97.5th percentile? The 100th percentile?

**Solution:**
