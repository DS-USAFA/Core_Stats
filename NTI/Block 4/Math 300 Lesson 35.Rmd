## Objectives

1. Explain and test the assumptions for inference in a linear regression model.


## Reading

[Chapter 10.3](https://moderndive.com/10-inference-for-regression.html#regression-conditions)

## Lesson

Work through the learning check LC 10.1

+ **LINE** is mnemonic to help remember the assumptions. Linearity, Independence, Normality, and Equality of variance.

+ Residuals are the key element used to check assumptions. Note that independence is difficult to check unless there is a time element to the data collection which often happens in experiments. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Libraries

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
library(moderndive)
```

## Problem

Let's briefly review the ideas from the reading before working the learning check.

### Data and model

Let's get the data again.

```{r}
evals_ch5 <- evals %>%
  select(ID, score, bty_avg, age)
glimpse(evals_ch5)
```

```{r}
score_model <- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals_ch5)
```


```{r}
score_regression_points <- get_regression_points(score_model)
```

```{r}
head(score_regression_points)
```


### Linearity

When we have a simple linear regression model, we can check linearity using a scatterplot of the explanatory and response variables. For multiple regression, we need to plot fitted values and residuals. We will do both here for our problem.

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(evals_ch5, 
       aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Beauty Score", 
       y = "Teaching Score",
       title = "Relationship between teaching and beauty scores") +  
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color="black") +
  geom_smooth(method="loess", se=FALSE) +
  theme_classic()
```

The `loess` function let's a plot a smoother through the data. The linearity assumption is not bad, there is a small issue at the lowest beauty score.


```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(score_regression_points, 
       aes(x = score_hat, y = residual)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Fitted Value", 
       y = "Residual",
       title = "Checking linearity assumption") +  
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color="black") +
  geom_smooth(method="loess", se=FALSE) +
  theme_classic()
```

We see a similar result except now we can generalize to multiple predictors.  

### Normality

We will build a histogram to check this assumption.

```{r}
ggplot(score_regression_points, aes(x = residual)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, fill = "cyan", color="black") +
  labs(x = "Residual") +
  theme_classic()
```

There is a skew to the left.

### Equality of Variance 

We could use the fitted vs residuals plot again for this or for simple linear regression we plot the explanatory variable against the residual. We want an equal spread around the horizontal line centered at zero. 

```{r}
ggplot(score_regression_points, aes(x = bty_avg, y = residual)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Beauty Score", y = "Residual") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "blue", size = 1)
```

```{r, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
chap <- 10
lc <- 0
```

## Learning Check 10.1 (Objective 1)

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Continuing with our regression using `age` as the explanatory variable and teaching `score` as the outcome variable.

- Use the `get_regression_points()` function to get the observed values, fitted values, and residuals for all `r nrow(evals_ch5)` instructors. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
evals_ch5 <- evals %>%
  select(ID, score, bty_avg, age)

# Fit regression model:
score_age_model <- lm(score ~ age, data = evals_ch5)
# Get regression points:
regression_points <- get_regression_points(score_age_model)
regression_points
```

- Perform a residual analysis and look for any systematic patterns in the residuals. Ideally, there should be little to no pattern but comment on what you find here.

The first condition is that the relationship between the outcome variable $y$ and the explanatory variable $x$ must be **L**inear. 

```{r non-linear2, fig.cap="Example of a clearly non-linear relationship.", echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.3}
set.seed(76)
evals_ch5 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = score)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Teaching Score") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color="black") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se=FALSE, color="blue") +
  expand_limits(y = 10)
```  

The relationship between score and age does seem to be linear. 

The second condition is that the residuals must be **I**ndependent. In other words, the different observations in our data must be independent of one another. As explained in the reading,  "we say there exists *dependence* between observations".

The third condition is that the residuals should follow a **N**ormal distribution.  

```{r model1residualshist2, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Histogram of residuals."}
ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = residual)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = "black", fill = "cyan") +
  labs(x = "Residual") +
  theme_classic()
```

The residuals are skewed to the left, so normality does not appear to be a reasonable assumption. 

The fourth and final condition is that the residuals should exhibit **E**qual variance across all values of the explanatory variable $x$. In other words, the value and spread of the residuals should not depend on the value of the explanatory variable $x$.  

```{r numxplot62, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Plot of residuals over beauty score."}
ggplot(regression_points, aes(x = age, y = residual)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Beauty Score", y = "Residual") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "blue", size = 1)
```  

This plot seems to justify the equality of variance assumption.
