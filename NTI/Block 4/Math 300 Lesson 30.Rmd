## Objectives

1. Correctly use terminology and notation of hypothesis testing.     

2.  Using the `infer` package, conduct a hypothesis test and interpret the results.

3. Compare and contrast confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.



## Reading 

[Chapter 9.2 - 9.3](https://moderndive.com/9-hypothesis-testing.html#understanding-ht)


## Lesson 

*Remember that you will be running this more like a lab than a lecture. You want them using `R` and answering questions. Have them open the notes rmd and work through it together.*

Work through the learning checks LC 9.1 - LC 9.4.

+ Spend time on the terminology. There are many new terms.

+ Try to write your own code for hypothesis tests and confidence from scratch using the `infer` package.  

+ Spend time interpreting p-values in the context of the problem.  We are trying to make a decision and the p-value and confidence interval help us.

### Libraries 

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
library(moderndive)
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2movies)
```


```{r, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
chap <- 9
lc <- 0
```

### LC 9.1 (Objective 2)

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Why does the following code produce an error? In other words, what about the response and predictor variables make this not a possible computation with the `infer` package?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(moderndive)
library(infer)
null_distribution_mean <- promotions %>%
  specify(formula = decision ~ gender, success = "promoted") %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))
```

**Solution**: Because the `decision` outcome variable is categorical and we can't compute a difference in means of a categorical variable. We can however compute the `diff in props` instead. 

### LC 9.2 (Objective 1)

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Why are we relatively confident that the distributions of the sample proportions will be good approximations of the population distributions of promotion proportions for the two genders?

**Solution**:  

We are only confident if the sample is representative of the population. 

### LC 9.3 (Objective 1)

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Using the definition of _p-value_, write in words what the $p$-value represents for the hypothesis test comparing the promotion rates for males and females.

**Solution**:  

The $p$-value represents that given there is no difference in promotion rates for males and females, it is the probability that the difference is as large or larger than the observed difference. 

### LC 9.4 (Objective 1)

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Describe in a paragraph how we used Allen Downey's diagram to conclude if a statistical difference existed between the promotion rate of males and females using this study.

**Solution**:  

We use the `promotions` dataset as the input for test statistic. The $H_0$ model is "there is no difference between promotion rates of males and females". We simulate data by shuffling the gender labels. This gives us the null distribution. We find the p-value by calculating how many simulated values were as large or larger than the observed value. We reject the $H_0$ model and conclude that there is a statistical difference existed between the promotion rate of males and females with males having a higher promotion rate.

### Using `infer`

Use `infer` to create a hypothesis and confidence interval for the promotion data set. Try to not use the book but using the following figure and the help menu. The data object is `promotions`.

![](ht.png)

```{r}
head(promotions)
```

```{r}
null_dist <- promotions %>%
  specify(formula=decision~gender,success = "promoted") %>%
  hypothesise(null="independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat="diff in props",order=c("male","female"))
```

```{r}
visualise(null_dist,bins=10)
```

Use code to get observed value.

```{r}
obs_value <- promotions %>%
  specify(formula=decision~gender,success = "promoted") %>%
  calculate(stat="diff in props",order=c("male","female"))
```


Get p-value

```{r}
null_dist %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_value, direction = "right")
```

Confidence interval

```{r}
boot_dist <- promotions %>%
  specify(formula=decision~gender,success = "promoted") %>%
#  hypothesise(null="independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat="diff in props",order=c("male","female"))
```


```{r}
get_ci(boot_dist,type="percentile")
```
