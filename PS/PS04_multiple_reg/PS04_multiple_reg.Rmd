# Introduction  

We will again use the hate crimes data we used in Problem Set 03. The FiveThirtyEight article article about those data are in the Jan. 23, 2017 article ["Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/higher-rates-of-hate-crimes-are-tied-to-income-inequality/). For this project, we will use these data  to run regression models with a single **categorical** predictor (explanatory) variable **and** a single **numeric** predictor (explanatory) variable. 

Remember you can knit this file to see the instructions. 

## Markdown File

Just like the first problem set, you will create a new rmarkdown file; you can refer to the first problem set for instructions. Name your file with the following format **PS04_lastname_firstname_section**

Fill in your answers to the exercises below with a corresponding exercise header in your rmarkdown file. Be sure to include text *and* code where necessary.

## Deliverable 

* You will turn in your completed problem set as a **knitted pdf file** to Gradescope. 

* Include a documentation statement.  

* Each exercise is worth 3 points. 

* Be sure to **make a header to label each Exercise**, this means using # followed by the word Exercise and the exercise number. 

* Please type your code to answer the questions in a code chunk (gray part), under the exercise headers and type (**BRIEF**) answers to any interpretation questions in the white part under the headers. 

## Setup

First load the necessary packages 

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(moderndive)
library(readr)
```

Next, load the data set from where it is stored on the web: 

```{r}
hate_crimes <- read_csv("http://bit.ly/2ItxYg3")
```

You can take a glimpse at the data like so: 

```{r}
glimpse(hate_crimes)
```

Be sure to also examine the data in the RStudio data viewer.

A summary of the data also helps us to understand our data.

```{r}
summary(hate_crimes)
```

Notice that 4 states do not have data for the response variable. As a simple fix, let's remove these values. In practice, we would want to investigate the nature of why these states are missing values.

```{r}
hate_crimes_ps4 <- hate_crimes %>%
  select(state, hs, income, urbanization) %>%
  na.omit()
```

**Use `hate_crimes_ps4` for all your work in this problem set.**

Each case/row in these data is a state in the US. This week we will consider the response variable `income`, which is the numeric variable of median income of households in each state. 

We will use

* A categorical explanatory variable `urbanization`: level of urbanization in a region
* A numerical explanatory variable `hs`: the percentage of adults 25 and older with a high school degree 


# Income, education and urbanization 

We will start by modeling the relationship between:

* $y$: Median household income in 2016
* $x_1$: numerical variable percent of adults 25 and older with a high-school degree, contained in the `hs` variable  
* $x_2$: categorical variable level of urbanization in a state: `low`,  or `high`, ascontained in the variable `urbanization`



1. Create a data visualization comparing median household `income` at "low" and "high" levels of urbanization (do not include the `hs` variable in this plot). Please include axis labels and title.




1. Next, let's add the high-school degree variable into the mix by creating a scatterplot showing: 

* Median household `income` on the $y$ axis
* Percent of adults 25 or older with a high school degree on the $x$ axis
* The points colored by the variable `urbanization`
* A line of best fit (regression line) for each level of the variable `urbanization` (one for "low", one for "high")

For this question, add the regression lines to the plot using the `geom_parallel_slopes` function from the `moderndive` package. This function will draw the regression lines based on fitting a regression model with parallel slopes (i.e., with no interaction between `hs` and `urbanization`).


1. Now let's create a second scatterplot using the same variables, but this time draw the regression lines using `geom_smooth()`, which will allow for separate, non-parallel slopes for each urbanization group.


1. Based on visually comparing the two models shown in Exercise 2 and Exercise 3, do you think it would be best to run a "parallel slopes" model (i.e. a model that estimates one shared slope for the two levels of urbanization), or a more complex "interaction model" (i.e. a model that estimates a separate slope for the two levels of urbanization)?


1. Fit the following two regression models that examine the relationship between household `income` (as response variable), and high-school education (`hs`) and `urbanization` as explanatory variables:

- A parallel slopes model (i.e., no interaction between `hs` and `urbanization`)
- A non-parallel slopes model (i.e., allow `hs` and `urbanization` to interact in your model)

Be sure to save the output from the `lm` function for each model.



1. Use the `get_regression_summaries()` function to find the unadjusted proportion of variance in `income` accounted for by each model, and report the value for each model


1. Compare the **adjusted** proportion of variance account for each model. Based on this comparison, which model do you prefer? Does your preference here agree or disagree with your earlier preference based on visualizing the predictions of each model?



**For Exercise  8 though 10, base your answers on the model you've selected in Exercise 7.**


1. What is the slope for the regression line of the states with a "high" level of urbanization? What is the intercept?


1. For every 1 percentage point increase of high-school educated adults in a state, what is the associated average increase in the median household income?




1. What would you predict as the median household income for a state with a **high** level of urbanization, in which 85% of adults have a high school degree? Careful with rounding!
