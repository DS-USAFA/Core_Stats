## Objectives

1. Correctly use terminology and notation of hypothesis testing.     

2.  Using the `infer` package, conduct a hypothesis test and interpret the results.

3. Compare and contrast confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.



## Reading 

[Chapter 9.2 - 9.3](https://moderndive.com/9-hypothesis-testing.html#understanding-ht)


## Lesson 

Work through the learning checks LC 9.1 - LC 9.4.

+ Spend time on the terminology. There are many new terms.

+ Try to write your own code for hypothesis tests and confidence from scratch using the `infer` package.

### Libraries 

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
library(moderndive)
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2movies)
```


```{r, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
chap <- 9
lc <- 0
```

### LC 9.1 (Objective 2)

**(LC 9.1)** Why does the following code produce an error? In other words, what about the response and predictor variables make this not a possible computation with the `infer` package?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(moderndive)
library(infer)
null_distribution_mean <- promotions %>%
  specify(formula = decision ~ gender, success = "promoted") %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))
```

**Solution**: 

### LC 9.2 (Objective 1)

**(LC 9.2)** Why are we relatively confident that the distributions of the sample proportions will be good approximations of the population distributions of promotion proportions for the two genders?

**Solution**:  



### LC 9.3 (Objective 1)

**(LC 9.3)** Using the definition of _p-value_, write in words what the $p$-value represents for the hypothesis test comparing the promotion rates for males and females.

**Solution**:  



### LC 9.4 (Objective 1)

**(LC 9.4)** Describe in a paragraph how we used Allen Downey's diagram to conclude if a statistical difference existed between the promotion rate of males and females using this study.

**Solution**:

### Using `infer`

Use `infer` to create a hypothesis and confidence interval for the promotion data set. Try to not use the book but using the following figure and the help menu. The data object is `promotions`.

```{r}
head(promotions)
```

- Find null distribtuion

```{r}

```

- Visualize the results

```{r}

```

- Use code to get observed value.

```{r}

```


- Get p-value

```{r}

```

Find bootstrap percentile confidence interval

- Get bootstrap distribution

```{r}

```

- Get confidence interval

```{r}

```
